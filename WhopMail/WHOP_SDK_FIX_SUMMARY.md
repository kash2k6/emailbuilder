# Whop SDK Authentication Fixes

## Issues Description
The application was experiencing production errors:
1. `TypeError: f.o.getUser is not a function`
2. `TypeError: f.o.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience is not a function`

These errors were occurring in the experience page authentication flow when trying to fetch user data and validate access using the Whop SDK.

## Root Causes
The code was incorrectly calling Whop SDK methods:
1. `whopSdk.getUser()` instead of `whopSdk.users.getUser()`
2. `whopSdk.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience()` instead of `whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience()`

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: User Data Fetching
**File:** `app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx`  
**Line:** 194

**Before:**
```typescript
user = await whopSdk.getUser({ userId, userToken: whopHeaders["x-whop-user-token"] || undefined })
```

**After:**
```typescript
user = await whopSdk.users.getUser({ userId })
```

### Fix 2: Experience Access Validation
**File:** `app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx`  
**Line:** 132

**Before:**
```typescript
accessResult = await whopSdk.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
  userId,
  experienceId: resolvedParams.experienceId,
  userToken: whopHeaders["x-whop-user-token"] || undefined
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
accessResult = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
  userId,
  experienceId: resolvedParams.experienceId
})
```

## Why These Fixes Work
1. **Correct SDK Structure**: The Whop SDK exposes methods under specific namespaces:
   - User methods under `users` namespace
   - Access methods under `access` namespace
2. **Simplified Parameters**: The methods only need the essential parameters, not additional tokens
3. **Proper Authentication Flow**: The SDK handles authentication internally using the configured API key

## Deployment Status
✅ **Successfully deployed to Vercel**
- **Production URL**: https://v0-whop-em-ail-with-make-h2t1zahi5-kash2k6s-projects.vercel.app
- **Build Status**: Completed successfully
- **All Routes**: Generated and functional

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves authentication errors in production
- ✅ Enables proper user data fetching
- ✅ Enables proper experience access validation
- ✅ Maintains security and authentication flow
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing
The fixes have been tested and verified to work with the correct Whop SDK method signatures as documented in the official Whop SDK documentation.
